        <h1 class="main">THE CRUCIBLE</h1>

    <p class="main">In this story, we can see the trait of integrity shown through out. This story represents both good and bad interarty. For starters, Abigale is an example of bad integrity. She had lied, deceived, and had bad moral principles. In the story, she constantly was doing what she wanted and trying to get what she wanted but in the end, she didn't get Proctor like she had hoped. She showed poor traits of integrity. A good example of Integrity would be Hale. He, throughout the story, was showing really good signs for integrity. He had done his best to help and save the people around him. He never lied to anyone and his morals were set right. He showed true integrity. The documents that follow also dive into integrity quit a bit. Newsletter article, obulary, and the website all involve around integrity through events. The news letter talkies about some of the events. Obalary talkies about John Proctor. Finally the website goes over acts one and two. These will all show integrity in the story of “The Crucible”.</p>

    <h2 class="main">Summary</h2>
    <p class="main">In the story of the Crucible, there are many events that happen in it that all eventually conclude around witchcraft. To start, in act one of the Crucible, Reverend Parris finds a bunch of the town girls dancing around a fire in the woods which was frowned upon at that time. After the discovery of this, the girls all run home in fear. The next day one of the girls, Betty Paris, was not waking up and when the doctor comes to see what's wrong with her, he can't find anything. At some point in this time, John Proctor has an affair with Abigail Willems. Then, Paris calls for an expert on witchcraft, Reverend Hale, to try and cure Betty. Ann Putnam also wants answers because her seven children she had all died as a baby. He comes and questions the girls for information and they point to Tituba. Tituba is Reverend Parris' slave from barbosa. Tituba was in the woods with the girls as they danced and was the one to lead them out there. Hale beats Tituba for information and to know if she had consulted with the devil. She eventually confesses and then lists a few people who also consulted with the devil. One of these was Sarah Good. These people don't actually consult with the devil but most people in the town end up believing they do. The girls also start to name the same people in order to save themselves from any trouble that might come their way.</p>

    <p class="main">In act two, John Proctor and his wife, Elizabeth Proctor, eat dinner together awkwardly. They did not want to discuss the fact that John had cheated on her. In this time, Mary Warren comes back from her new job at the court and gives Elizabeth a poppet she made at court. She also informed them that 39 people have been convicted of the crime of witchcraft. She also says that Elisabeth was brought up in court and that she defended her. Then, Hale shows up and questions Elizabeth. He sees the poppet and asks her about it and she tells him that it was a gift from Mary. Hale questions if they can say all ten commandments and John Proctor recites all but one commandment and it was the one involving adultery. Then, Cheever and Harack show up with a warrant to arrest Elizabeth. They explain that earlier that day, Abigale was found stabbed with a needle and the poppet had a needle in the same spot. After they cease Elizabeth, John loses his temper and rips the warrant. Once Elizebeth has left the premises, Procter makes Marry confess to lying about witchcraft in front of the court in order to save Elizebeth from being hanged.</p>
