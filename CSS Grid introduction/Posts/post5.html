    <h2 class="main">Recipe</h2>
    <ul class="main-part">
    <li>Butter and sugar: Cream these two together to get a batter that bakes up light and fluffy. Comes from Honey and fruits. Butter comes from milk/cows.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs provide binding power, helping keep all the ingredients together. Eggs also promote rising in the cupcakes as they bake. From chickens.</li>
    <li>Canned pumpkin: Be sure to use canned pumpkin, sometimes called pumpkin puree. Don't use pumpkin pie filling, which has additional ingredients. Comes from strain of Dickinson squash.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour: The protein in all-purpose flour provides structure when the cupcakes are baked. Comes from  a dried grain, seed or a fruit.</li>
    <li>Spices: Pumpkin pie spice, ground cinnamon and ground ginger give the cupcakes bold and delicious flavors. Comes from roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, and seeds.</li>
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder is the main rising agent in this pumpkin cupcake recipe. Comes out the ground in the form of minerals nahcolite and trona.</li>
    <li>Baking soda: You'll need some extra baking soda to counter the acidity of the buttermilk. Baking powder contains baking soda and cream of tartar. If you use baking powder only, plus buttermilk, the cupcakes won't rise very much because the acidity of the buttermilk and the acidity of the cream of tartar overwhelm the baking soda. So, add extra baking soda in addition to what's in the baking powder to counter all that acidity and get the cupcake batter to rise. Comes out the ground in the form of minerals nahcolite and trona.</li>
    <li>Buttermilk: After all that explanation about baking soda and buttermilk, why add the buttermilk to begin with? It makes the pumpkin spice cupcakes tender and adds a lot of moisture without making the cupcakes seem too moist after baking. Comes from a cow.</li>
    <li>Frosting: Avrige royal or plastic frosting.</li>
    <li>Cream cheese: Cream cheese gives the frosting a thick texture and tangy taste. Is cream, milk, an acid and salt.</li>
    <li>Butter: Adding butter to the cream cheese helps make it more spreadable and smoother. It also gives the frosting a warmer, more buttery taste. Butter comes from milk/cows.</li>
    <li>Confectioners' sugar: Adding confectioners' sugar to the frosting makes it lighter, and obviously much sweeter. The sugar won't erase the tangy flavor of the cream cheese but will mellow it out enough to create a really tasty frosting. Comes from sugarcane and sugar beets.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract and cinnamon: Vanilla extract and cinnamon provide some subtle flavoring. Comes from orchids in the genus Vanilla.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="main-part2">Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Make the batter</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Cream the butter and sugar together for five to seven minutes in a large bowl, mixing until the ingredients are light and fluffy. Add the eggs one by one, beating each one into the mixture before adding another. Add the pumpkin. In another large bowl, combine the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda and ginger. Alternate adding the dry mixture and the buttermilk to the creamed mixture. Beat the batter well after each addition.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Bake the cupcakes</h3>
    <p>Line muffin cups with paper liners. Fill the cups 3/4 full and bake them for 20 to 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcakes should come out clean when the cupcakes are done baking. Let the cupcakes cool for 10 minutes in the pan, and then place them on a wire rack to cool down completely.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Mix the frosting</h3>
    <p>In a large, clean bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter together until the mixture is fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar, then the vanilla and cinnamon. Beat the whole mixture until it's smooth and spreadable. Frost the cupcakes.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Apply frosting and enjoy</h3>
